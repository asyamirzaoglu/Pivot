This project provides a Kotlin-based pivot table similar to what you might find in Excel. 
This implementation is ideal for use in various data analysis tasks. Its flexible design allows you to adapt it to your specific needs, whether you are working with sales data, financial reports, or any other dataset requiring pivot table functionality.
Below, you'll find details on how to integrate this implementation with your data, customize filters, and adjust headers according to your needs.

Features:

-Dummy Data Integration: The current implementation uses dummy data to demonstrate functionality. You can easily integrate this pivot table with your own data by replacing the dummy data with your actual dataset.
-Filter Application: Use the applyFilters variable to enable or disable filtering. When set to true, filters specified in the filters variable will be applied, allowing you to refine your data view according to specific criteria.

-Header Configuration: The rowHeaders variable allows you to define multiple row headers in any desired order. You can specify as many row headers as needed.

-Column Headers: The pivot table is designed to support a fixed structure of three column headers. This implementation works with one, two, or three column headers. If you need a more dynamic setup to support additional column headers, modifications can be made to accommodate more.

-Value Field: The valueField variable represents the data values in the pivot table, similar to the values section in Excel. The current implementation supports a single value field. However, if required, the code can be adjusted to support multiple value fields.


Feel free to integrate this pivot table into your data analysis workflows and customize it to suit your needs. Its flexibility and dynamic nature make it a valuable tool for handling complex data scenarios. For any further customization or questions, consult the code comments.
